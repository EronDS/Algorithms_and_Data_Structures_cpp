# Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository contains implementations of various algorithms and data structures in C++. My focus is on understanding the theoretical foundations while developing practical implementations independently, referring to books only when necessary.

## Approach

The theoretical concepts are primarily studied from books.

Implementations are done practically, without strictly following book examples, except when needed.

The code is continuously improved and optimized over time.

## References

The following resources have been used for theoretical understanding:

Adam Drozdek – Algorithms and Data Structures in C++

Cogniterra – Data Structures Course

## Notes

Some parts of the code may still be optimized further.

This is a work in progress, and improvements will be made iteratively.

## Contributions

Suggestions and optimizations are always welcome!
